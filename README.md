This is a Go library for making bots to be used on Facebook messenger. It is built on the [Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform). One of the main goals of the project is to implement it in an idiomatic and easy to use fashion.

You can find [examples for this library here](https://github.com/retailcrm/messenger/blob/master/examples/).

## Tips

- Follow the [quickstart](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart) guide for getting everything set up!
- You need a Facebook development app, and a Facebook page in order to build things.
- Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to tunnel your locally running bot so that Facebook can reach the webhook.
